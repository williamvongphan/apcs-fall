/***
    driver for class Coin
    ~~~ SUGGESTED WORKFLOW: ~~~
    1. Compile this file and run. Note anything notable.
    2. Move the "TOP" line down, so that it is below the first statement.
    (emacs: with cursor at beginning of TOP line, C-k C-k, DOWN, DOWN, C-y)
    (your editor: ???)
    3. Compile and run again.
    4. Resolve errors one at a time until it works.
    5. Repeat 2-4 until TOP meets BOTTOM.
